# Voter-Elgibility
Helps user determine if they are able to vote in the incoming election.


Create a Java program that will help someone determine whether they are able to vote in the
upcoming election. There are four criteria that are required for any person to be an eligible
voter. They must be at least 18 years old, be a citizen of the United States, be a resident of a
state, and be registered to vote in that state. The program should either tell the user that they are
eligible to vote or to give them all the reasons why they are not eligible to vote. After the
program informs the user, it should ask the user whether they would like to check for another
person. If the user selects that they would like to check for another person then the program
should repeat the entire process from the beginning. This program should only end when a user
decides they no longer want to check for another person.
This program does not need to check if age is greater than or equal to 0.
